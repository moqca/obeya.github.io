### why **hello**?  

### **hello** has a simple goal: to make GitHub Pages accessible to everyone.  
  
**hello** is a minimalist template that lets you design a beautiful website or portfolio on GitHub Pages - without installing a Ruby
development environment, learning to use Jekyll, **or even typing a single line of code**. It's ideal for GitHubbers
who want to start building their personal website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but maybe aren't so familiar with web development.
